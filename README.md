# waifu2x-tensorrt
waifu2x-tensorrt is a TensorRT implementation of the waifu2x super-resolution model. This project aims to improve the inference speed for faster image upscaling on NVIDIA GPUs.

**Note**: This project is currently under active development by a high school student (that's me!). As a result, some features may be missing, and bugs can be expected. Contributions and feedback are welcome though!

## Installation
### Precompiled Version
A precompiled version of the program can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/z3lx/waifu2x-tensorrt/releases) section.

### Building from source
1. Install the dependencies:
   - [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
   - [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/releases/) with CUDA support (version >= 4.8.0)
   - [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt)
   - [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
   - [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
   
   Refer to the [support matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/support-matrix/index.html) for compatible TensorRT, CUDA, and cuDNN versions.
3. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/z3lx/waifu2x-tensorrt.git
cd waifu2x-tensorrt
```
3. Build the project files using CMake:

build
  Build model
```

### Building a model
Before being able to upscale an image or a video using a particular configuration, the model needs to be built into an optimized engine. To do so, use the build subcommand and specify the model, the scale, the noise, the batch size, and the tile size: 
```
waifu2x-tensorrt build --model swin_unet/art --scale 4 --noise 3 --batchSize 4 --tileSize 256
```
Depending on the configuration, this process might take a while to complete, and TensorRT might fail if VRAM is insufficient. 

### Upscaling an image or a video
To upscale an image or a video, use the render subcommand and specify the upscaling configuration and input files:
```
waifu2x-tensorrt render --model swin_unet/art --scale 4 --noise 3 --batchSize 4 --tileSize 256 --input path/to/file1.png path/to/file2.mp4 path/to/files
```
